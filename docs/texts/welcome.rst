The word **fabric** denotes a texture, and a LAF resource can be seen as a texture of annotations to
a primary data source. 

In other languages than English, and possibly in English as well, fabric also denotes a place were 
stuff is made. For etymology, see `faber <http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/faber>`_.
The location of industry, a factory (but that word derives from the slightly different 
`facere <http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/facio>`_).

What if you want to study the data that is in the fabric of a LAF resource?
You need tools. And what if you want to add your own tapestry to the fabric?

You need an interactive environment where tools can be developed and data can be combined.

This is the LAF Fabric, and here is a simple example of what you can do with it:

* `gender notebook <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dirkroorda/laf-fabric/blob/master/examples/gender.ipynb>`_

People at the Theology Department of the VU University Amsterdam are producing notebooks for their research
into the text of the Hebrew Bible, see

* `Judith Gottschalk's github repository <https://github.com/judithgottschalk/ETCBC-data>`_
* `Gino Kalkman's github repository <https://github.com/GinoKalkman/Biblical_Hebrew_Analysis>`_

LAF-Fabric includes a specialized module called *etcbc* to support working with the Hebrew Text Database of the ETCBC.
