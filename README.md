[text-fabric-data](https://github.com/ETCBC/text-fabric-data).
The set of features has changed slightly.
A corresponding **new version** of this feature documentation is available at
[text-fabric-data: docs](https://etcbc.github.io/text-fabric-data/features/hebrew/etcbc4c/0_overview.html).

> Data version **etcbc4c** is not (yet) available in SHEBANQ, 
only in 
[Text-Fabric](https://github.com/ETCBC/text-fabric/wiki),
the successor of LAF-Fabric.
LAF-Fabric stays around in order to run legacy notebooks.
It is recommended to use **Text-Fabric** for new work.
